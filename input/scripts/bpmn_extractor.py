"""
BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) Extractor

This module provides functionality to extract and transform BPMN files into
FHIR resources for the SMART guidelines system. BPMN files typically define
clinical workflows, decision trees, and other healthcare process flows.

The extractor processes BPMN XML files using XSLT transformations to convert
business process definitions into FHIR-compatible formats suitable for
implementation in clinical decision support systems.
